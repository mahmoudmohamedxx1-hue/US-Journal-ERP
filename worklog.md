Task ID: gh-push
Agent: main
Task: Push US Journal ERP to GitHub as a new repo named "US Journal ERP" and configure for ongoing sync

Work Log:
- Created GitHub repo `mahmoudmohamedxx1-hue/US-Journal-ERP` via GitHub API (public)
- Configured git remote with the provided Personal Access Token
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts (release/, electron/dist/, db/*.db, download/*.AppImage, etc.)
- Created comprehensive `README.md` with feature overview, tech stack, demo credentials, build instructions
- Created `.env.example` (since `.env` is gitignored)
- Initial commit pushed (commit `63b1fa2`) — full source code, ~136 files
- Created `GITHUB_ACTIONS.md` documenting the CI workflow YAML (token lacks `workflow` scope, so workflow file must be added via GitHub web UI)
- Second commit pushed (commit `4a64734`) — GITHUB_ACTIONS.md
- Set up git credential helper (`~/.git-credentials`) so future pushes work automatically without re-entering the token
- Verified repo is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedxx1-hue/US-Journal-ERP

Stage Summary:
- Repo URL: https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedxx1-hue/US-Journal-ERP
- Default branch: `main`
- 2 commits pushed (initial + GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)
- Future updates will be pushed automatically using the stored credential
- The token has repo scope but lacks `workflow` scope, so GitHub Actions YAML must be added via web UI (instructions in GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)

Next Steps for User:
1. Visit the repo on GitHub
2. (Optional) Add `.github/workflows/build.yml` via the web UI using the YAML in GITHUB_ACTIONS.md to enable auto-builds
3. Any future updates I make will be pushed to this repo automatically
